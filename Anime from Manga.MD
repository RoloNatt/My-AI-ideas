# Generate Anime from Manga

## Summary

Feed the manga as input, and extract its text and art. A model will be trained on this. The art can be converted into video (there are some AI tools that do this). Another model will be trained for already existing manga and anime. The text will be fed to the text-to-audio AI tools. There are AI tools that have a lot of voices, so every character can be given a separate voice.

- Animation

### Process
- **Data collection:** 
The first step in building an AI tool that can generate anime from manga is to gather a large dataset of manga and anime. This dataset should include annotated manga and anime, with labels for characters, actions, and dialogue.
- **Preprocessing:** 
Once the dataset is collected, it needs to be preprocessed to extract useful features for the AI model. This can include text extraction from the manga, image segmentation to separate the characters and backgrounds, and annotation of character actions and dialogue.
- **Training the AI model:** 
The next step is to train the AI model on the preprocessed data. This involves building a deep learning model, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image recognition and a recurrent neural network (RNN) for natural language processing. The model should be trained on the preprocessed dataset, with the goal of learning the relationships between the text and images in the manga.
- **Anime generation:** 
Once the AI model is trained, it can be used to generate anime from manga. This involves feeding the manga text and images into the model, which generates an anime sequence based on the input. The generated anime can then be rendered using computer graphics software, such as Blender or Maya, or converted into a video format.
- **Audio generation:** 
To generate audio for the characters, a text-to-speech AI tool can be used. These tools use deep learning algorithms to convert text into speech, and some even allow for customization of the voice to match the character's personality.
- **Post-processing:**
The final step is to post-process the generated anime and audio to refine the quality of the output. This can include editing the animation to improve the smoothness of movements and adding sound effects and music to enhance the viewing experience.
